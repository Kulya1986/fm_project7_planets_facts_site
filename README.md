## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass] (https://sass-lang.com/) - a stylesheet language compiled to CSS

### What I learned

While working on this project I've leveraged my understanding of creating well-structured React projects. I've learned how to load and use custom fonts via @font-face rule instead of loading them from external servers. I've also sharpened up my skills in building responsive layouts with CSS grid and flexbox.

### Continued development

In next projects will aim to work on refining my skills in building mobile and responsive layouts. Also want to add more dynamics and interaction to the sites with React library solutions.
